## Abstract
The aim of this paper is to propose a machine learning model to predict the sale price of used cars. To train and validate the model a dataset obtained from scraping Ebay is used, consisting of user-submitted listings of various car models in various conditions. A crucial part of the problem was dealing with large amount of missing values, false and placeholder listings and overall outlier detection. After cleaning the dataset various machine learning models are compared to Ô¨Ågure out the best one for the task. An ensemble-like model is also developed which proved a small improvement in overall performance. The performance of both solutions are then evaluated, resulting in good results, especially considering the training data in use, but with room for improvements.
